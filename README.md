## Overview

This repository showcases two different approaches to creating Docker containers:

1. **Using a `Dockerfile`**
2. **Using `packer.hcl` with Packer**

Both methods demonstrate container image creation with automation tools commonly used in DevOps workflows.

## Contents

- `Dockerfile` – Standard Docker container build definition.
- `packer.hcl` – Packer template to build Docker images.
- `fibonacci.py` – Sample Python script that generates a Fibonacci sequence.
- `kla_task_1.sh`, `kla_task_2.sh` – Shell scripts for basic tasks.
- `KLA_DEVOPS.zip` – Archive with additional DevOps-related resources
